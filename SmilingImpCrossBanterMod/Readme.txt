SMILING IMP’S «CROSS BANTER MOD»

Author:  Smiling Imp
Mod support - Austin

This is an add-on to the mod «BG1 NPCs for SoA&ToB» (http://www.shsforums.net/files/file/974-bg1-npcs-for-soa-tob/). 

It must be installed AFTER «BG1 NPCs for SoA&ToB» mod and after all other NPC mods. It adds dialogue between Smiling Imp’s NPCs and other NPCs (Silver Star, Varshoon, Biddekelorak, Yasraena, Saerileth, Tsujatha, Horace, Kindrek, NPCs from "The Beaurin Legacy" mod etc.)

The mod is compatible with BG2, BG2: EE and EET.


CHANGELOG:
1.0 (22/03/2014)  – Mod is released

1.2 (10/08/2021) – many edits:
* Reworked and improved the installation of the mod - now only those dialogs are installed for which there are the necessary NPCs. The installer checks the presence of an NPC without the participation of the player
* Added additional component - cross-mod dialogs with "Wilson Chronicles" mod by Lava. Now Smiling Imp's NPC will sometimes comment on dialogs from this mod. Proofreading of the English text by sarevok57
* The component with alternative portraits has been removed. Most of them are already included in the main mod "BG1 NPC in BG2", here it is no longer needed and only complicated the installation
* Restored dialogues between Adrian with Xzar and Montaron. Previously, they remained in the "Crossmod Banter Pack", but were disabled there. Now they have been moved here and will be installed along with the rest of the dialogs
* Found errors in the code have been fixed
* Mod uploaded to GitHub
* Updated Russian translation

1.3 (19/12/2021) – minor fixes

1.4 (24/12/2021) – minor fixes

1.5 (24/07/2022) – added banters between NPCs from Smiling Imp and NPCs from jmaeq's "The Beaurin Legacy" mod

1.6 (29/12/2022) – added readme-file
